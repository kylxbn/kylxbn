# Hello, world.

I'm Kyle (@kylxbn). I build small, slightly impractical software that scratches specific itches: audio tools, codecs, odd UIs, and experiments that feel like "I wonder if this would work" and then it goes "I wonder how far I can take this..."

Most of the repositories here are old experiments--it's like some time capsule of when I was still young and had the free time to build lots of silly unfinished things. Some are serious personal projects. Some are private. But most of what I do now is for work and those are not listed in my personal GitHub account.

## Featured projects

- **[Pixel Exchange Format (PXF)](https://github.com/kylxbn/pixel-exchange-format)**: a codec that encodes audio/binary data into fixed-width images (with FEC + integrity checks).  
- **[Impulse](https://github.com/kylxbn/impulse)**: a no-nonsense music player built around mpv IPC (playlist/details, ReplayGain, lyrics, MPRIS on Wayland).  
- **[kmus](https://github.com/kylxbn/kmus)**: sync/transcode your master music archive to portable devices (ReplayGain-aware, album-art handling, JSON DB).  
- **[jxl-migrate](https://github.com/kylxbn/jxl-migrate)**: bulk-convert folders of images to JPEG XL.  
- **[K Virtual Machine (KVM)](https://github.com/kylxbn/kvm)**: my own VM with replaceable components (CPU/RAM/GPU) + assembler + bootloader experiments.  
- **[ZLEMA/EMA for Google Sheets](https://github.com/kylxbn/google-apps-script-zlema)**: Google Apps Script custom functions for moving averages.  

## I like working on

- Digital audio and DSP experiments
- Codecs, media compression, and file formats in general (the older the better... but the newer the better also)
- Tiny utilities whenever I feel like "I should be able to automate this in one command"

## Grab bag

If you like odd little tools, you might also enjoy:

- [dpcm-reverse](https://github.com/kylxbn/dpcm-reverse): flip NES DPCM sample bit order in ROMs
- [passgen](https://github.com/kylxbn/passgen): generate high-entropy passphrases that are still typable
- [matrixmath](https://github.com/kylxbn/matrixmath): for when you suddenly get the urge to invert matrices
